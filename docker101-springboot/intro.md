Container technology is a new technology that's quickly gaining acceptance in the IT community.  There are many reasons for this:

1. They are very small and quick to start. Start times are measured in seconds compared to the minutes virtual machines require.
2. Containers are immutable. Once created the container image can't be changed without being rebuilt giving the container a new unique id. This helps with testing, security and stability.
3. Containers are highly portable. They will run on many different clouds and across many different container platforms.
4. Containers use very little computer resources compared to other technologies.

This exercise will give you an idea of how to build a container and show you some characteristics of it.
