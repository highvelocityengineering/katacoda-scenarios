To review we've compiled our hello world code, packaged that code into a docker image and ran that docker image as a container. We also saw that the file system and processes of the host machine and the container are separate.  

With a container's ability to carry it's dependencies with it and it's small size the container is very easy to run across many platforms and is specifically well suited for the cloud.  This demo just touches the very surface of the container ecosystem.  There are whole subjects to explore and learn.  You may want to start looking at the microservices architecture as a development paradigm or Kubernetes for orchestrating multiple containers to form a large application.
