The window that you're currently reading is the tutorial window.  It's where you'll read the demo information and enter commands.

The small window in the middle is the file directory window.  This is where you can view file locations.   

The large window to the right is the directory view, this will show the contents of any files you select in the directory window. 

Below the directory window and view is the Terminal where your commands will run.  This is where you can see the action.
